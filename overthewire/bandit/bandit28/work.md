If you knew how git-works, this'll be a simple challenge for you.
`GIT` is a great tool for developers and people who continuously upgrades or rollbacks the version of their files or codes, etc...

Since it's a vast topic, I suggest you to study a bit on it by investing some of your time.
After learning it, you'll really feel like "Why didn't I learn this great tool?" for sure!
So, it's worth of investing your time.

Hope you've learnt something new from this [if you don't know this before/didn't strike to you during the start].

Now, let's use the password `bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2` to log into the remote-machine as `bandit29`.

**Warning: Please, first try Level 29 -> Level 30! Otherwise it's useless to simply cpy-pst the command[s]/password[s].
