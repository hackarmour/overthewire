This level is quite easy!
By following the `Level Goal` of Bandit Level 0 â†’ Level 1;
we got the password of user[bandit1] as shown below.

```
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme 
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
bandit0@bandit:~$ 
```

Let's use the password `boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1` to log into the remote-machine as `bandit1`.

**Warning: Please, first try Level 1 -> Level 2! Otherwise it's useless to simply cpy-pst the command[s]/password[s].
