Very simple challenge!
![Bandit8](https://github.com/sreekesari-vangeepuram/overthewire/blob/master/overthewire/bandit/bandit8/level8-%3Elevel9.png)

So, what should we do here?
Let's see what the challenge statement says:
`The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once`

Let's get the password for bandit9 user from the file `data.txt`

```
bandit8@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR
bandit8@bandit:~$
```
That's it!

But do you know what `sort` and `uniq` does?
Let's see what are they:
```
Usage: sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  or:  sort [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
Ordering options:

  -b, --ignore-leading-blanks  ignore leading blanks
  -d, --dictionary-order      consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters
  -f, --ignore-case           fold lower case to upper case characters
  -g, --general-numeric-sort  compare according to general numerical value
  -i, --ignore-nonprinting    consider only printable characters
  -M, --month-sort            compare (unknown) < 'JAN' < ... < 'DEC'
  -h, --human-numeric-sort    compare human readable numbers (e.g., 2K 1G)
  -n, --numeric-sort          compare according to string numerical value
  -R, --random-sort           shuffle, but group identical keys.  See shuf(1)
      --random-source=FILE    get random bytes from FILE
  -r, --reverse               reverse the result of comparisons
      --sort=WORD             sort according to WORD:
                                general-numeric -g, human-numeric -h, month -M,
                                numeric -n, random -R, version -V
  -V, --version-sort          natural sort of (version) numbers within text

Other options:

      --batch-size=NMERGE   merge at most NMERGE inputs at once;
                            for more use temp files
  -c, --check, --check=diagnose-first  check for sorted input; do not sort
  -C, --check=quiet, --check=silent  like -c, but do not report first bad line
      --compress-program=PROG  compress temporaries with PROG;
                              decompress them with PROG -d
      --debug               annotate the part of the line used to sort,
                              and warn about questionable usage to stderr
      --files0-from=F       read input from the files specified by
                            NUL-terminated names in file F;
                            If F is - then read names from standard input
  -k, --key=KEYDEF          sort via a key; KEYDEF gives location and type
  -m, --merge               merge already sorted files; do not sort
  -o, --output=FILE         write result to FILE instead of standard output
  -s, --stable              stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison
  -S, --buffer-size=SIZE    use SIZE for main memory buffer
  -t, --field-separator=SEP  use SEP instead of non-blank to blank transition
  -T, --temporary-directory=DIR  use DIR for temporaries, not $TMPDIR or /tmp;
                              multiple options specify multiple directories
      --parallel=N          change the number of sorts run concurrently to N
  -u, --unique              with -c, check for strict ordering;
                              without -c, output only the first of an equal run
  -z, --zero-terminated     line delimiter is NUL, not newline
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

KEYDEF is F[.C][OPTS][,F[.C][OPTS]] for start and stop position, where F is a
field number and C a character position in the field; both are origin 1, and
the stop position defaults to the line's end.  If neither -t nor -b is in
effect, characters in a field are counted from the beginning of the preceding
whitespace.  OPTS is one or more single-letter ordering options [bdfgiMhnRrV],
which override global ordering options for that key.  If no key is given, use
the entire line as the key.  Use --debug to diagnose incorrect key usage.

SIZE may be followed by the following multiplicative suffixes:
% 1% of memory, b 1, K 1024 (default), and so on for M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

*** WARNING ***
The locale specified by the environment affects sort order.
Set LC_ALL=C to get the traditional sort order that uses
native byte values.

So I think you've already guessed what `sort` does.
Simply from it's name, we can say that it sorts the data in the file in an alphabetical order if they are numbers.
Else, it sorts according to the values of number in an order.

Then what's about `uniq`?
```
Usage: uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Filter adjacent matching lines from INPUT (or standard input),
writing to OUTPUT (or standard output).

With no options, matching lines are merged to the first occurrence.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -c, --count           prefix lines by the number of occurrences
  -d, --repeated        only print duplicate lines, one for each group
  -D                    print all duplicate lines
      --all-repeated[=METHOD]  like -D, but allow separating groups
                                 with an empty line;
                                 METHOD={none(default),prepend,separate}
  -f, --skip-fields=N   avoid comparing the first N fields
      --group[=METHOD]  show all items, separating groups with an empty line;
                          METHOD={separate(default),prepend,append,both}
  -i, --ignore-case     ignore differences in case when comparing
  -s, --skip-chars=N    avoid comparing the first N characters
  -u, --unique          only print unique lines
  -z, --zero-terminated     line delimiter is NUL, not newline
  -w, --check-chars=N   compare no more than N characters in lines
      --help     display this help and exit
      --version  output version information and exit

A field is a run of blanks (usually spaces and/or TABs), then non-blank
characters.  Fields are skipped before chars.

Note: 'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent.
You may want to sort the input first, or use 'sort -u' without 'uniq'.

So, uniq identifies the uniq lines from a file given as an argument!
Also you might've understood why I used <tag -u>, from the above documentation!

Hope you've learnt something new from this [if you don't know this before/didn't strike to you during the start].

Now, let's use the password `UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR` to log into the remote-machine as `bandit9`.

**Warning: Please, first try Level 9 -> Level 10! Otherwise it's useless to simply cpy-pst the command[s]/password[s].
